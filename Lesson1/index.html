    <p><i>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the
        late
        1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in
        the United States and the United Kingdom.[1] It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that
        drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock
        music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated
        influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the
        electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Usually,
        rock is song-based music with a time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely
        diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that
        are frequently social or political.

        Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded
        music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions
        lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music
        industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s "classic rock"[1] period, a number of distinct rock
        music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga
        rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by
        the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which
        extended the artistic elements, glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and
        enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s,
        punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in
        the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.</i></p>

    <p>The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s
        and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a melding of
        various black musical genres of the time, including rhythm and blues and gospel music, with country and
        western.[24] In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music (then termed
        "race music") for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to
        describe the music.[25]

        Debate surrounds the many recordings which have been suggested as "the first rock and roll record". Contenders
        include Wynonie Harris' "Good Rocking Tonight" (1948);[26] Goree Carter's "Rock Awhile" (1949);[27] Jimmy
        Preston's "Rock the Joint" (1949), which was later covered by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1952;[28] and "Rocket
        88" by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (in fact, Ike Turner and his band the Kings of Rhythm), recorded by
        Sam Phillips for Sun Records in 1951.[29] Four years later, Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock" (1955) became
        the first rock and roll song to top Billboard magazine's main sales and airplay charts, and opened the door
        worldwide for this new wave of popular culture.[30][31]</p>

    <h2>Pop rock and instrumental rock</h2></a>
    <p>he term pop has been used since the early 20th century to refer to popular music in general, but from the
        mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer
        alternative to rock and roll.[48][49] From about 1967, it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock
        music, to describe a form that was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible.[21] In contrast rock music was
        seen as focusing on extended works, particularly albums, was often associated with particular sub-cultures (like
        the counterculture of the 1960s), placed an emphasis on artistic values and "authenticity", stressed live
        performance and instrumental or vocal virtuosity and was often seen as encapsulating progressive developments
        rather than simply reflecting existing trends.[21][48][49][50] Nevertheless, much pop and rock music has been
        very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content.[nb 1]</p>

    <h2>Surf music</h2></a>
    <p>The instrumental rock and roll of performers such as Duane Eddy, Link Wray and the Ventures was developed by Dick
        Dale, who added distinctive "wet" reverb, rapid alternate picking, and Middle Eastern and Mexican influences. He
        produced the regional hit "Let's Go Trippin'" in 1961 and launched the surf music craze, following up with songs
        like "Misirlou" (1962).[65] Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern
        California, including the Bel-Airs, the Challengers, and Eddie & the Showmen.[65] The Chantays scored a top ten
        national hit with "Pipeline" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's "Wipe Out", by the
        Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965.[66]</p>

<div class="rock_item4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#British_Invasion">
    <h2>British Invasion</h2></a>
    <p>By the end of 1962, what would become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like the Beatles, Gerry
        & the Pacemakers and the Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers, Herman's Hermits and the Hollies
        from Manchester. They drew on a wide range of American influences including 1950s rock and roll, soul, rhythm
        and blues, and surf music,[70] initially reinterpreting standard American tunes and playing for dancers. Bands
        like the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast,[71] and particularly those from London like the Rolling
        Stones and the Yardbirds, were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music.[72] Soon
        these groups were composing their own material, combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy
        beat. Beat bands tended towards "bouncy, irresistible melodies", while early British blues acts tended towards
        less sexually innocent, more aggressive songs, often adopting an anti-establishment stance. There was, however,
        particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies.[73] By 1963, led by
        the Beatles, beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain, soon to be followed into the charts
        by the more rhythm and blues focused acts.[74]</p>

<div class="rock_item5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#Garage_rock">
    <h2>Garage rock</h2></a>
    <p>Garage rock was a raw form of rock music, particularly prevalent in North America in the mid-1960s and so called
        because of the perception that it was rehearsed in the suburban family garage.[87][88] Garage rock songs often
        revolved around the traumas of high school life, with songs about "lying girls" and unfair social circumstances
        being particularly common.[89] The lyrics and delivery tended to be more aggressive than was common at the time,
        often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming.[87] They ranged from crude
        one-chord music (like the Seeds) to near-studio musician quality (including the Knickerbockers, the Remains, and
        the Fifth Estate). There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes
        particularly in California and Texas.[89] The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had
        perhaps[according to whom?] the most defined regional sound.[90]</p>

<div class="rock_item6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#Blues_rock">
    <h2>Blues rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>Although the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&B based acts,
        the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American
        blues, including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.[97] British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early
        1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as Lead Belly, who was a major influence on the
        Skiffle craze, and Robert Johnson.[98] Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound, often centered on the
        electric guitar, based on the Chicago blues, particularly after the tour of Britain by Muddy Waters in 1958,
        which prompted Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to form the band Blues Incorporated.[99] The band
        involved and inspired many of the figures of the subsequent British blues boom, including members of the Rolling
        Stones and Cream, combining blues standards and forms with rock instrumentation and emphasis.[61]</p>

    <h2>Folk rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>By the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival had grown to a major movement,
        utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments.[105]
        In America the genre was pioneered by figures such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and often identified with
        progressive or labor politics.[105] In the early sixties figures such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan had come to the
        fore in this movement as singer-songwriters.[106] Dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits
        including "Blowin' in the Wind" (1963) and "Masters of War" (1963), which brought "protest songs" to a wider
        public,[107] but, although beginning to influence each other, rock and folk music had remained largely separate
        genres, often with mutually exclusive audiences.[108]</p>

</div>
<div class="rock_item8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#Psychedelic_rock">
    <h2>Psychedelic rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>Psychedelic music's LSD-inspired vibe began in the folk scene.[116] The first group to advertise themselves as
        psychedelic rock were the 13th Floor Elevators from Texas.[116] The Beatles introduced many of the major
        elements of the psychedelic sound to audiences in this period, such as guitar feedback, the Indian sitar and
        backmasking sound effects.[117] Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California's emerging music scene as
        groups followed the Byrds's shift from folk to folk rock from 1965.[117] The psychedelic lifestyle, which
        revolved around hallucinogenic drugs, had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products
        of the scene were Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane.[117][118] The
        Jimi Hendrix Experience's lead guitarist, Jimi Hendrix did extended distorted, feedback-filled jams which became
        a key feature of psychedelia.[117] Psychedelic rock reached its apogee in the last years of the decade. 1967 saw
        the Beatles release their definitive psychedelic statement in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, including
        the controversial track "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", the Rolling Stones responded later that year with Their
        Satanic Majesties Request,[117] and the Pink Floyd debuted with The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Key recordings
        included Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow and the Doors' Strange Days.[119] These trends peaked in the
        1969 Woodstock festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts.[117]</p>

    <h2>Progressive rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>Progressive rock, a term sometimes used interchangeably with art rock, moved beyond established musical formulas
        by experimenting with different instruments, song types, and forms.[123] From the mid-1960s the Left Banke, the
        Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, had pioneered the inclusion of harpsichords, wind, and string
        sections on their recordings to produce a form of Baroque rock and can be heard in singles like Procol Harum's
        "A Whiter Shade of Pale" (1967), with its Bach-inspired introduction.[124] The Moody Blues used a full orchestra
        on their album Days of Future Passed (1967) and subsequently created orchestral sounds with synthesizers.[123]
        Classical orchestration, keyboards, and synthesizers were a frequent addition to the established rock format of
        guitars, bass, and drums in subsequent progressive rock.[125]</p>

</div>
<div class="rock_item10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#Jazz_rock">
    <h2>Jazz rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>In the late 1960s, jazz-rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues-rock, psychedelic, and progressive
        rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. AllMusic
        states that the term jazz-rock "may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz
        camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation." Jazz-rock "...generally
        grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s", including the
        singer-songwriter movement.[138] Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of
        these elements into the new music. In Britain the subgenre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like
        Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce of the Eric Clapton-fronted band Cream, had emerged from the British jazz scene.
        Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New
        York-based the Free Spirits with Out of Sight and Sound (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use
        the label were R&B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like Electric Flag, Blood,
        Sweat & Tears and Chicago, to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and the
        early 1970s.[139]</p>

    <h2>1970s commodification</h2>
</a>
    <p>The decade is, of course, an arbitrary schema itself—time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future
        every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts—money, say—the category does take on a reality of its own
        once people figure out how to put it to work. "The '60s are over," a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or
        so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had.
        In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an elitist withdrawal from the messy concert and counterculture
        scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in FM radio and album rock.</p>

</div>
<div class="rock_item12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#Roots_rock">
    <h2>Roots rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>Roots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic
        scene, to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences, particularly country and
        folk music, leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock.[141] In 1966 Bob Dylan went to Nashville
        to record the album Blonde on Blonde.[142] This, and subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, have
        been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of largely acoustic folk
        musicians.[142] Other acts that followed the back-to-basics trend were the Canadian group the Band and the
        California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and
        blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s.[143] The same movement saw the
        beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell
        George,[144] and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones' Beggar's Banquet
        (1968) and the Beatles' Let It Be (1970).[117] Reflecting on this change of trends in rock music over the past
        few years, Christgau wrote in his June 1970 "Consumer Guide" column that this "new orthodoxy" and "cultural lag"
        abandoned improvisatory, studio-ornamented productions in favor of an emphasis on "tight, spare instrumentation"
        and song composition: "Its referents are '50s rock, country music, and rhythm-and-blues, and its key inspiration
        is the Band."[145]</p>

    <h2>Glam rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>lam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an
        extension of and reaction against those trends.[149] Musically diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll
        revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art rock of Roxy Music, and can be seen as much as a
        fashion as a musical subgenre.[149] Visually it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood
        glamor, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war Cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles,
        science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes,
        makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots.[150] Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and
        representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics.[151] It was prefigured by the showmanship and
        gender-identity manipulation of American acts such as the Cockettes and Alice Cooper.[152]</p>

    <h2>Chicano rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>After the early successes of Latin rock in the 1960s, Chicano musicians like Carlos Santana and Al Hurricane
        continued to have successful careers throughout the 1970s. Santana opened the decade with success in his 1970
        single "Black Magic Woman" on the Abraxas album.[159] His third album Santana III yielded the single "No One to
        Depend On", and his fourth album Caravanserai experimented with his sound to mixed reception.[160][161] He later
        released a series of four albums that all achieved gold status: Welcome, Borboletta, Amigos, and Festivál. Al
        Hurricane continued to mix his rock music with New Mexico music, though he was also experimenting more heavily
        with Jazz music, which led to several successful singles, especially on his Vestido Mojado album, including the
        eponymous "Vestido Mojado", as well as "Por Una Mujer Casada" and "Puño de Tierra"; his brothers had successful
        New Mexico music singles in "La Del Moño Colorado" by Tiny Morrie and "La Cumbia De San Antone" by Baby
        Gaby.[162] Al Hurricane Jr. also began his successful rock-infused New Mexico music recording career in the
        1970s, with his 1976 rendition of "Flor De Las Flores".[163][164] Los Lobos gained popularity at this time, with
        their first album Los Lobos del Este de Los Angeles in 1977.</p>

    <h2>Soft rock, hard rock, and early heavy metal</h2>
</a>
    <p>From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often
        derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies.[166] Major
        artists included Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor.[166] It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to
        late 1970s with acts like Billy Joel, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose Rumours (1977) was the
        best-selling album of the decade.[167] In contrast, hard rock was more often derived from blues-rock and was
        played louder and with more intensity.[168] It often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument
        using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and
        other effects.[168] Key acts included British Invasion bands like the Kinks, as well as psychedelic era
        performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the Jeff Beck Group.[168] Hard rock-influenced bands that enjoyed
        international success in the later 1970s included Queen,[169] Thin Lizzy,[170] Aerosmith, AC/DC,[168] and Van
        Halen.</p>

    <h2>Christian rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>Rock, mostly the heavy metal genre, has been criticized by some Christian leaders, who have condemned it as
        immoral, anti-Christian and even satanic.[175] However, Christian rock began to develop in the late 1960s,
        particularly out of the Jesus movement beginning in Southern California, and emerged as a subgenre in the 1970s
        with artists like Larry Norman, usually seen as the first major "star" of Christian rock.[176] The genre was
        mostly a phenomenon in the United States.[177] Many Christian rock performers have ties to the contemporary
        Christian music scene. Starting in the 1980s Christian pop performers have had some mainstream success. While
        these artists were largely acceptable in Christian communities, the adoption of heavy rock and glam metal styles
        by bands like Stryper, who achieved considerable mainstream success in the 1980s, was more
        controversial.[178][179] From the 1990s there were increasing numbers of acts who attempted to avoid the
        Christian band label, preferring to be seen as groups who were also Christians, including P.O.D.[180]</p>

    <p>American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern

        heartland rock was first used to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx, but
        which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk,
        country and rock and roll.[181] It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast
        country rock and the Southern rock of the American South.[182] Led by figures who had initially been identified
        with punk and New Wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Creedence
        Clearwater Revival and Van Morrison, and the basic rock of 1960s garage and the Rolling Stones.[183]</p>

    <h2>Punk rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock
        and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of
        mainstream 1970s rock.[188] They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down
        instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic,
        with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.[189]</p>

    <h2>New wave</h2>
</a>
    <p>Although punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon, it achieved less in the way of record sales
        (being distributed by small specialty labels such as Stiff Records),[195] or American radio airplay (as the
        radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as disco and album-oriented rock).[196] Punk
        rock had attracted devotees from the art and collegiate world and soon bands sporting a more literate, arty
        approach, such as Talking Heads and Devo began to infiltrate the punk scene; in some quarters the description
        "new wave" began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands.[197] Record executives, who had been
        mostly mystified by the punk movement, recognized the potential of the more accessible new wave acts and began
        aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or new wave.[198] Many
        of these bands, such as the Cars and the Go-Go's can be seen as pop bands marketed as new wave;[199] other
        existing acts, including the Police, the Pretenders and Elvis Costello, used the new wave movement as the
        springboard for relatively long and critically successful careers,[200] while "skinny tie" bands exemplified by
        the Knack,[201] or the photogenic Blondie, began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory.[202]</p>

    <p>If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its
        commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early 1980s as its more artistic and challenging side.
        Major influences beside punk bands were the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and the New
        York-based no wave scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as James Chance and the
        Contortions, DNA and Sonic Youth.[207] Early contributors to the genre included the US bands Pere Ubu, Devo, the

    <h2>Emergence of alternative rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the
        mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed "alternative" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct
        from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore,
        New Wave or the post-punk movements.[213] Important alternative rock bands of the 1980s in the US included
        R.E.M., Hüsker Dü, Jane's Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies,[213] and in the UK the Cure, New Order, the
        Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Smiths.[214] Artists were largely confined to independent record labels, building
        an extensive underground music scene based on college radio, fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth.[215] They
        rejected the dominant synth-pop of the early 1980s, marking a return to group-based guitar
        rock.[216][217][218]</p>

    <h2>Grunge</h2>
</a>
    <p>Disaffected by commercialized and highly produced pop and rock in the mid-1980s, bands in Washington state
        (particularly in the Seattle area) formed a new style of rock which sharply contrasted with the mainstream music
        of the time.[222] The developing genre came to be known as "grunge", a term descriptive of the dirty sound of
        the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians, who actively rebelled against the over-groomed images of
        other artists.[222] Grunge fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound, and made heavy
        use of guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback.[222] The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and
        often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment, although it was also known for its dark humor
        and parodies of commercial rock.[222]</p>

<div class="rock_item23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music#Britpop">
    <h2>Britpop</h2>
</a>
    <p>Britpop emerged from the British alternative rock scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands
        particularly influenced by British guitar music of the 1960s and 1970s.[214] The Smiths were a major influence,
        as were bands of the Madchester scene, which had dissolved in the early 1990s.[83] The movement has been seen
        partly as a reaction against various US-based, musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
        particularly the grunge phenomenon and as a reassertion of a British rock identity.[214] Britpop was varied in
        style, but often used catchy tunes and hooks, beside lyrics with particularly British concerns and the adoption
        of the iconography of the 1960s British Invasion, including the symbols of British identity previously utilised
        by the mods.[227] It was launched around 1993 with releases by groups such as Suede and Blur, who were soon
        joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass, and Elastica, who produced a series of successful albums and
        singles.[214] For a while the contest between Blur and Oasis was built by the popular press into the "Battle of
        Britpop", initially won by Blur, but with Oasis achieving greater long-term and international success, directly
        influencing later Britpop bands, such as Ocean Colour Scene and Kula Shaker.[228] Britpop groups brought British
        alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement known as Cool
        Britannia.[229] Although its more popular bands, particularly Blur and Oasis, were able to spread their
        commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement had largely fallen apart by the end
        of the decade.[214]</p>

    <h2>Post-grunge</h2>
</a>
    <p>The term post-grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream and
        subsequent hiatus of the Seattle grunge bands. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a
        more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound.[226] Often they worked through the major labels and came to
        incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop, pop-punk, alternative metal or hard rock.[226] The term
        post-grunge originally was meant to be pejorative, suggesting that they were simply musically derivative, or a
        cynical response to an "authentic" rock movement.[230] Originally, grunge bands that emerged when grunge was
        mainstream and were suspected of emulating the grunge sound were pejoratively labelled as post-grunge.[230] From
        1994, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's new band, the Foo Fighters, helped popularize the genre and define its
        parameters.[231]</p>

    <p>The origins of 1990s pop punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like
        Buzzcocks and the Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as the Jam and the Undertones, and the more
        hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s.[233] Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and
        chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars.[234] Punk music provided the inspiration for some
        California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid, Pennywise, Weezer and Green
        Day.[233] In 1994 Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album Dookie, which found a new, largely
        teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including
        two number ones in the US.[213] They were soon followed by the eponymous debut from Weezer, which spawned three
        top ten singles in the US.[235] This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band
        the Offspring with Smash (1994).[213] This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day's
        Nimrod (1997) and the Offspring's Americana (1998).[236]</p>

    <h2>Indie rock</h2>
</a>
    <p>In the 1980s the terms indie rock and alternative rock were used interchangeably.[237] By the mid-1990s, as
        elements of the movement began to attract mainstream interest, particularly grunge and then Britpop, post-grunge
        and pop-punk, the term alternative began to lose its meaning.[237] Those bands following the less commercial
        contours of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie.[237] They characteristically attempted
        to retain control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels, while relying
        on touring, word-of-mouth, and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion.[237] Linked by an
        ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged,
        grunge-influenced bands like the Cranberries and Superchunk, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like
        Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco.[213][214] It has been noted that indie rock has a
        relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the
        development of feminist-informed Riot grrrl music.[238] Many countries have developed an extensive local indie
        scene, flourishing with bands with enough popularity to survive inside the respective country, but virtually

    <p>From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia, and Britpop as a movement began to
        dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it.[261][262]
        Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock),[263] particularly
        the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Small Faces,[264] with American influences, including post-grunge.[265][266]
        Drawn from across the United Kingdom (with several important bands emerging from the north of England, Scotland,
        Wales and Northern Ireland), the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centered on British,
        English and London life and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height.[267][268]

    <p>During the 2010s, rock music saw a decline in mainstream popularity and cultural relevancy; by 2017, hip hop

        dance music,[296] the rise of streaming, and the advent of technology which has changed approaches toward music
        creation as being factors.[297] Ken Partridge of Genius suggested that hip-hop became more popular because it is
        a more transformative genre and does not need to rely on past sounds, and that there is a direct connection to
        the decline of rock music and changing social attitudes during the 2010s.[295] Bill Flanagan, in a 2016 opinion
        piece for The New York Times, compared the state of rock during this period to the state of jazz in the early
        1980s, "slowing down and looking back."[298] Vice suggests that this decline in popularity could actually

The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop,[1] while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.[2]

    Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling" and "In the End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; the latter crossed over to the pop chart.[4] Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success.[5] The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).[6] By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.[7]</b></p>

    <img src="images/17.jfif" alt=""><p><i>Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.

    Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.</i></p>
